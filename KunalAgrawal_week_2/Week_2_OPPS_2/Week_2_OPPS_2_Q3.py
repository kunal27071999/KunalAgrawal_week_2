3. Write difference between inheretance and composition

"""

"""
Inheritance is used where a class wants to derive the nature of parent class 
and then modify or extend the functionality of it. Inheritance will extend the
functionality with extra features allows overriding of methods, but in the case
of Composition, we can only use that class we can not modify or extend the
functionality of it. It will not provide extra features. Thus, when one needs
to use the class as it without any modification, the composition is recommended and
when one needs to change the behavior of the method in another class, then inheritance is recommended.
