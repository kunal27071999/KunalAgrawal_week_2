"""
13. Write short note on static variables

"""

"""
All objects share class or static variables.
An instance or non-static variables are different for different objects (every object has a copy).
For example, let a Computer Science Student be represented by class CSStudent.
The class may have a static variable whose value is “cse” for all objects.
And class may also have non-static members like name and roll.
In C++ and Java, we can use static keywords to make a variable a class variable. 
The variables which don’t have a preceding static keyword are instance variables.
See this for Java example and this for C++ example.
The Python approach is simple; it doesn’t require a static keyword.
